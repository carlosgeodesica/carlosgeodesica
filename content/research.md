### Abstract

The M2 secondary mirror of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, scheduled to be commissioned on-sky in 2024, will be the first active secondary mirror of 3.5m diameter in operation. Its substantial dimensions and advanced functionalities place it in league with the secondary mirrors of the upcoming 30m class telescopes. Characterizing its performance serves as a critical step towards comprehending and controlling the optics of the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). This study focuses on testing and validating the M2 cell in the Observatory’s integration hall and at the Telescope Mount Assembly (TMA). We also report on the integration steps of the M2 cell onto the TMA itself, including installing the light baffle. During the testing campaign, the M2 cell is equipped with an aluminum mirror surrogate for safety reasons regarding the glass mirror. To ensure integrity when the thin glass mirror (10cm) is installed onto the telescope, the M2 support system must be actively controlled during any M2 cell movement. This prompted the development of a dedicated control system to enable closed loop mode for transporting the M2 cell with the glass mirror from the integration hall to the telescope. The tests in the integration hall were conducted with the M2 cell mounted on a rotating cart, allowing different orientations with respect to gravity as it will experience on the telescope. Upon reaching the telescope, static and dynamic tests are conducted at progressively higher telescope performance, increasing slewing speed, acceleration, and jerk. A significant novelty introduced by Rubin to astronomical instrumentation is the Verification & Validation architecture as part of the model-based Systems Engineering approach where requirements, test procedures and executions are merged into an interlaced and dynamic flow. This report presents the experimental results from the distinct test campaigns covering a wide range of M2 cell functionalities. These include characterization of actuator behavior in terms of maximum stroke and force limits, evaluation of closed-loop (active) and open-loop (passive) support system operation for the M2, system settling time and Force Balance response to different slewing speeds of the telescope.

### Abstract. 

An Eclipse is an astronomical event that convenes a large audience. Few days before it, most of the community is aware of the event and the press is activated fully on it. The alignment recovers our most intrinsic human aspects, the curiosity, and enthusiasm for a natural phenomenon. This work is focused to enjoy and perceive it in three different ways: visually, listening, and in an artistic expression. We focused on the construction of more than one hundred LightSound devices, which the main purpose is to record the light intensity and transform it into different tones. Besides, we created an artistic representation of the Eclipse motivated by the ancestral culture of the people residing in the totality zone. This music adds a sensorial joy to the eclipse event.

### Abstract. 

**Context.** The open cluster (OC) NGC 2453 is of particular importance since it has been considered to host the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 2452, however their distances and radial velocities are strongly contested.

**Aims.** In order to obtain a complete picture of the fundamental parameters of the OC NGC 2453, 11 potential members were studied.The results allowed us to resolve the PN NGC 2452 membership debate.

**Methods.** Radial velocities for the 11 stars in NGC 2453 and the PN were measured and matched with Gaia data release 2 (DR2) to estimate the cluster distance. In addition, we used deep multi-band UBVRI photometry to get fundamental parameters of the cluster via isochrone fitting on the most likely cluster members, reducing inaccuracies due to field stars.

**Results.** The distance of the OC NGC 2453 (4.7 ± 0.2 kpc) was obtained with an independent method solving the discrepancy reported in the literature. This result is in good agreement with an isochrone fitting of 40–50 Myr. On the other hand, the radial velocity of NGC 2453 (78 ± 3 km s−1) disagrees with the velocity of NGC 2452 (62 ± 2 km s−1). Our results show that the PN is a foreground object in the line of sight.

**Conclusions.** Due to the discrepancies found in the parameters studied, we conclude that the PN NGC 2452 is not a member of the OC NGC 2453.

   ### Abstract.

**Aim.** The outer atmosphere of K giants shows thermally inhomogeneous structures consisting of the hot chromospheric gas and the cool molecular gas. We present spectro-interferometric observations of the multicomponent outer atmosphere of the well-studied K1.5 giant Arcturus (α Boo) in the CO first overtone lines near 2.3 μm.

**Methods.** We observed Arcturus with the AMBER instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.28–2.31 μm with a spectral resolution of 12 000 and at projected baselines of 7.3, 14.6, and 21.8 m.

**Results.** The high spectral resolution of the VLTI/AMBER instrument allowed us to spatially resolve Arcturus in the individual CO lines. Comparison of the observed interferometric data with the MARCS photospheric model shows that the star appears to be significantly larger than predicted by the model. It indicates the presence of an extended component that is not accounted for by the current photospheric models for this well-studied star. We found out that the observed AMBER data can be explained by a model with two additional CO layers above the photosphere. The inner CO layer is located just above the photosphere, at 1.04 ± 0.02 R⋆, with a temperature of 1600 ± 400 K and a CO column density of 10ˆ(20 ± 0.3) cmˆ(−2). On the other hand, the outer CO layer is found to be as extended as to 2.6 ± 0.2 R⋆ with a temperature of 1800 ± 100 K and a CO column density of 10ˆ(19 ± 0.15) cmˆ(−2).


**Conclusions.** The properties of the inner CO layer are in broad agreement with those previously inferred from the spatially unresolved spectroscopic analyses. However, our AMBER observations have revealed that the quasi-static cool molecular component extends out to 2–3 R⋆, within which region the chromospheric wind steeply accelerates.
